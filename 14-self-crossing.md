## Self Crossing

You are given an array of integers `distance`. You start at the point (0, 0) on an X-Y plane, and you move `distance[0]` meters to the north, then `distance[1]` meters to the west, `distance[2]` meters to the south, `distance[3]` meters to the east, and so on. After each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Return `true` if your path crosses itself, or `false` if it does not.
