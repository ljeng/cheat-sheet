## Substring with Concatenation of All Words

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of words are of the same length.

A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

 1. For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then `"abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab"` are all
    concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`. 

Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
