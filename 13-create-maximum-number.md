## Create Maximum Number

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively. These arrays represent the digits of two numbers. You are also given an integer `k`.

Your task is to create the maximum number of length `k` (where `k â‰¤ m + n`) by selecting digits from the two arrays. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.

Return an array of the `k` digits representing the maximum number.
